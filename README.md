Project Name: Code Trather

Project Description:
Our senior design project is a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that addresses the issue of cheating during in-class coding assignments. Our IDE is equipped with essential features such as Python syntax highlighting, command line input, and the ability to upload Python unit test files for auto-grading. With our application, students can write, debug, and test their code all in one place, providing convenience and efficiency. To ensure academic integrity, our IDE logs student keystrokes, monitors their window activity, tracks running processes, and encrypts all submitted assignments to prevent unauthorized access. The app comes in two parts, one is the student version that is distributed to students and the other is the teacher version. The student version includes all the features above while the teacher version is designed to help the teacher access/manage the studentsâ€™ work. Our C# windows forms app is built in Visual Studio and is designed to help instructors maintain fair evaluation and promote academic integrity. Our project provides a valuable tool for students and educators alike, enabling a better learning experience, and paving the way for a more honest and equitable academic environment.
